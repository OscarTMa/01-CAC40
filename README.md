## CAC40
The CAC 40 is the main stock market index of the Paris Bourse. It is a market-capitalization-weighted index that reflects the performance of the 40 largest and most actively traded stocks listed on Euronext Paris.

Created with 1,000 base points on December 31, 1987, by the Compagnie des agents de change, the CAC 40 index (originally meaning Compagnie des Agents de Change, now Cotation Assist√©e en Continu) is determined based on the prices of forty continuously traded stocks on the premier market among the hundred companies with the most active trading on Euronext Paris, which is part of Euronext, the leading European stock exchange. These companies, representative of various industries, are intended to reflect the overall trend of the French large-cap economy, and their list is regularly reviewed to maintain this representativeness. It is a price index with no dividends. It is listed every business day from 9 AM to 5:30 PM and is updated every 15 seconds.
